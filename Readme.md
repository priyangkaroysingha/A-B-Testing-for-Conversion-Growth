# AB-Testing

## Project Overview
To understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Requriements
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib

## Conclusion
Based on the findings of the statistical tests that we performed - the Z-test, the logistic regression model, and the actual difference observed - demonstrated that the new and old pages had almost identical chances of converting consumers. Thus, the null hypothesis is not rejected. The e-commerce business should retain the previous/old page that may result in saving both time and money when building a new page.
